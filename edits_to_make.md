This will be vertical layout on very large touch screens. Therefore, the buttons currently at the top need to be moved so they can be accessed.

- Tours
    - Get rid of "Share" button in the tour
- Links should not be clickable (idk if this is a code thing or kiosk-mode thing)
- Reset to default after a couple minutes of inactivity (or have it move through the tree like it does on the homepage of the website?)
    - Would be easiest to just make kiosk reload to this: https://localhost:8000/life/@biota=93302?otthome=%40%3D1028829#x223,y1324,w1.3060
- ~~COMPLETE: OneZoom logo top left: disable homepage link~~
- ~~COMPLETE: Trace a path and search bar can be moved to bottom middle (users will type with pop-up on-screen keyboard)~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Trace path boxes need to stack upwards, not downwards~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Search bar pop-up suggestions need to appear above search bar, not below~~
- ~~COMPLETE: Settings button can be moved to bottom left, above Tours~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Remove some setting options: Terms of Use, Image Sources, Search Mode, only keep color-blind friendly option, Language, Page Content~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Remove all the links inside Settings Information, delete irrelevant info from the modals, fix formatting~~
- ~~COMPLETE: In the pop-ups for each organism, the top header bar should be moved to the bottom, delete expand button~~
- ~~COMPLETE: We actually want to move things more to the bottom middle if possible so tall people can still reach them~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Move up the reset, zoom buttons, and move Settings to the right side underneath these and revert it back to just an icon (no words next to it)~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Move up Tours and Location (get rid of the word labels) and shift the search features to the left under these~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Just leave the Wikipedia modal buttons on the bottom~~
- ~~COMPLETE (it already did this): Make search options show up on click rather than mouseover (the advanced search options show up when you click on them so mimic this)~~
- ~~COMPLETE: Remove link in image information for Open in a new page--just remove the header~~
- ~~COMPLETE: Put in IUCN data and images--had to get a new Docker container~~
