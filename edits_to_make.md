This will be vertical layout on very large touch screens. Therefore, the buttons currently at the top need to be moved so they can be accessed.

- Put in IUCN data--actually probably can't do this right now, have to wait until OneZoom team figures out a solution for this (IUCN changed how the data can be used and OneZoom is no longer allowed to use it the way they were)
    - So let's make the tree color setting green and brown
- Some of the images are here, why not more?
- Make search options show up on click rather than mouseover (the advanced search options show up when you click on them so mimic this)
- The "Color blind friendly" checkbox doesn't stick (can just get rid of this if we won't have IUCN data)
- Reset to default after a couple minutes of inactivity (or have it move through the tree like it does on the homepage of the website?)
- Make sure images and colors and Tours work once I have the database data
    - Actually, looks like Tours maybe won't work? Delete if so
- ~~COMPLETE: OneZoom logo top left: disable homepage link~~
- ~~COMPLETE: Trace a path and search bar can be moved to bottom middle (users will type with pop-up on-screen keyboard)~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Trace path boxes need to stack upwards, not downwards~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Search bar pop-up suggestions need to appear above search bar, not below~~
- ~~COMPLETE: Settings button can be moved to bottom left, above Tours~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Remove some setting options: Terms of Use, Image Sources, Search Mode, only keep color-blind friendly option, Language, Page Content~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Remove all the links inside Settings Information, delete irrelevant info from the modals, fix formatting~~
- ~~COMPLETE: In the pop-ups for each organism, the top header bar should be moved to the bottom, delete expand button~~
- ~~COMPLETE: We actually want to move things more to the bottom middle if possible so tall people can still reach them~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Move up the reset, zoom buttons, and move Settings to the right side underneath these and revert it back to just an icon (no words next to it)~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Move up Tours and Location (get rid of the word labels) and shift the search features to the left under these~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Just leave the Wikipedia modal buttons on the bottom~~
