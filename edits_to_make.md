This will be vertical layout on very large touch screens. Therefore, the buttons currently at the top need to be moved so they can be accessed.

- We actually want to move things more to the bottom middle if possible so tall people can still reach them
    - ~~COMPLETE: Move up the reset, zoom buttons, and move Settings to the right side underneath these and revert it back to just an icon (no words next to it)~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Move up Tours and Location (get rid of the word labels) and shift the search features to the left under these~~
    - The search now (that it's skinnier) doesn't display enough info to explain advanced search--what do I do about this?
    - What to do about the Wikipedia, etc modal buttons? These don't really work on the side. Just leave them on the bottom?
- Is the search going to work as a touchscreen? Where the suggestions come up on mousehover rn? Will they also show up if I click in it? (the advanced search options only show up when you click on them so mimic this)
- The "Color blind friendly" checkbox doesn't stick
- Reset to default after a couple minutes of inactivity (or have it move through the tree like it does on the homepage of the website?)
- Make sure images and colors and Tours work once I have the database data
    - Actually, looks like Tours maybe won't work? Delete if so
- ~~COMPLETE: OneZoom logo top left: disable homepage link~~
- ~~COMPLETE: Trace a path and search bar can be moved to bottom middle (users will type with pop-up on-screen keyboard)~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Trace path boxes need to stack upwards, not downwards~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Search bar pop-up suggestions need to appear above search bar, not below~~
- ~~COMPLETE: Settings button can be moved to bottom left, above Tours~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Remove some setting options: Terms of Use, Image Sources, Search Mode, only keep color-blind friendly option, Language, Page Content~~
    - ~~COMPLETE: Remove all the links inside Settings Information, delete irrelevant info from the modals, fix formatting~~
- ~~COMPLETE: In the pop-ups for each organism, the top header bar should be moved to the bottom, delete expand button~~
