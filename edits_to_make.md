This will be vertical layout on very large touch screens. Therefore, the buttons currently at the top need to be moved so they can be accessed.
- COMPLETE: OneZoom logo top left: disable homepage link
- COMPLETE: Trace a path and search bar can be moved to bottom middle (users will type with pop-up on-screen keyboard)
    - COMPLETE: Trace path boxes need to stack upwards, not downwards
    - COMPLETE: Search bar pop-up suggestions need to appear above search bar, not below
- COMPLETE: Settings button can be moved to bottom left, above Tours
    - COMPLETE: Remove some setting options: Terms of Use, Image Sources, Search Mode, only keep color-blind friendly option, Language, Page Content
    - COMPLETE: Remove all the links inside Settings Information, delete irrelevant info from the modals, fix formatting
- COMPLETE: In the pop-ups for each organism, the top header bar should be moved to the bottom, delete expand button
- We actually want to move things more to the bottom middle if possible so tall people can still reach them
- Make sure images and tours work once I have the database data
    - Actually, looks like Tours maybe won't work? Delete if so
- Reset to default after a couple minutes of inactivity (or have it move through the tree like it does on the homepage of the website?)
- The "Color blind friendly" checkbox doesn't stick
