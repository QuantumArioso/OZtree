                        <h3>Benefits of working with us</h3>
                        
                         <ol>
                             <li>We're <strong>registered as a not for profit organisation</strong>, everything we do is with the aim of science communication around biodiversity, evolution and conservation.</li>
                             <li>We offer <strong>a partnership scheme with the aim of sharing what we've created for free</strong>.</li>
                             <li>Our team includes a <strong>range of experts in biology, computing and science communication</strong>.</li>
                             <li>Any not-for-profit venues choosing the option of including leaf sponsorship in their displays can <strong>benefit through sharing of donations</strong> made through their display.</li>
                             <li>We foster close <strong>mutual relationships with data providers</strong> including Encyclopedia of Life and Open Tree of Life.</li>
                             <li>The OneZoom software has been a <strong>recognised leader in this field for nine years</strong>.</li>
                             <li>We've built the whole visualisation codebase from the ground up with tree of life visualisation in mind, so <strong>everything is optimised for this use case</strong> and easily adapted.</li>
                             <li>Our reach stretches beyond museum installations and includes a significant online presence as well as uptake with <strong>other media types</strong> including books such as the Ancestor's Tale by Richard Dawkins and Yan Wong. These multiple angles feed into each other synergistically.</li>
                         </ol>
