<h1>Tree being generated</h1>
<h3>{{=time}}</h3>
The routine
<pre>ServerScripts/TreeBuild/generate_crowdfunding_files.py -v -db XXX://XXX_database</pre>
has just been called to generate a new crowdfunding tree. A new tree should be produced in about an hour or two. To check, look for the file <pre>{{=lockfile}}</pre>, which will disappear when it is done. The output is being stored in <pre>{{=logfile}}</pre>.
{{else:}}
<h1>Tree processing already going on</h1>
I think there is already a tree being generated. Please wait, or remove the file in <pre>{{=lockfile}}</pre>
